# BinanceBot
Alpha v 0,01

Consists of only one logic. Works only with BTC. 
SET up: enviroment viariables to api: key, secret. Working on testnet (can be changed to work in real binance enviroment).

To do (not final):
Refactoring,adding classes,thinking about possible patterns than I will move to:

1. Add more logic when to buy, sell
2. Add function to remember the price of order to make sure you never lose money ( it's meant for long term holders in case of sudden price drop)
3. Add other cryptocurrencies

Other plans:
Set up docker, make website to show bot results.
